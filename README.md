- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bauer96
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in WebDevelopement, Building cool Websites / try some own projects. 
want to learn how to build beautiful websites with HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and master the FullStack Developer Part in on Codecademy.
 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me - at the moment only per github or Stackoverflow maybe in the next time i will create some Social Media Accounts like Instagram to share my results and steps per step.
If you have any Questions feel free and ask me. If you have some tips for me, show me my "fails" and help me to get better and better with the code.
so in future i will share here my projects  
 
stay tuned and happy coding <3
