- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bauer96
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in WebDevelopement, Building cool Websites / try some own projects. 
want to learn how to build beautiful websites with HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript with a curse on udemy, with my own project Ideas and with the Challenges Program from Frontendmentor
 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me - at the moment only per github or Stackoverflow maybe in the next time i will create some Social Media Accounts like Instagram to share my results and steps per step.
If you have any Questions feel free and ask me. If you have some tips for me, show me my "fails" and help me to get better and better with the code.
so in future i will share here my projects / challenges from Frontendmentor etc. 
 
stay tuned and happy coding <3
